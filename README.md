# Node.js Starter Application

Bluemix provides a Node.js starter application as a template so that you can
add your code and push the changes back to the Bluemix environment.

## Files

The Node.js starter application has files as below:

* app.js

	This file contains the server side JavaScript code for your application
	written using the express server package.

* public/

	This directory contains public resources of the application, that will be
	served up by this server

* package.json

	This file contains metadata about your application, that is used by both
	the `npm` program to install packages, but also Bluemix when it's
	staging your application.  For more information, see:
	<https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>
